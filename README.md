# Chatons Admin

This is the project that allows us to manage Chatons's Minecraft servers.

## ❓ Why ?

With our friends, we want to self-host our own Minecraft servers. We want to be able to manage them, viewing them, and this is the reason why I decided to create this project.

## 🔍 How it works ?

This project is composed of two parts:

- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that is the admin interface.
- A [Go](https://go.dev/) server that is the backend of the admin interface.

## 🚀 How to use it ?

You can start the services independently, but the easiest way to start is to use the docker compose file that is provided in the root of the project :

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the backend and the frontend, in development mode.

## 📄 Documentation

Documentations can be found in respective services folders :

- [Backend](backend/README.md)
- [Frontend](frontend/README.md)

## 😺 Who are "Chatons" ?

"Chatons" is a nickname given to me and my wife by our friends, because we love cats.

# Chatons Admin Frontend

This is the frontend of the admin interface for Chatons's Minecraft servers.

## 🔍 How it works ?

The frontend is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that is used to manage the Minecraft servers.

It uses the [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) library for the UI.

## 🚀 How to use it ?

You can start the frontend with the following command :

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Start production server
pnpm build && pnpm start
```
